# Corroded_Beam_Bending_Prediction
This repository allows an engineer to input data and genereate preidctions using a database of 725 corroded beam specimens tested under monotnic bending. The output predictions include the maximum  bending moment, residual capacity percentage, yield load, yield idsplacement, and ultimate displacement.
